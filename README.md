# 🔓 ReGhosted #

**ReGhosted** is a lightning-fast GUI utility, fully rewritten in C++, that automates **CyberGhost trial refresh** and **temporary account regeneration** with one click.  

Originally a Python CLI tool called [`fuckVITBPL`](https://github.com/sillyLazyCat/fuckVITBPL), which was **slow and bloated (150MB+)**, this version is a **full C++ rewrite**: super fast, ultra-lightweight (~100KB), and packaged as a standalone `.exe`.
